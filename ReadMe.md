The code that I wrote is the script.js file and the index.html.

The user is intended to look at the data and get a quick idea of the "best" colors of the set, as well as a subset of the "best cards". Both pickrate and winrate are important stats, so I use those to determine what are the "best" that gets presented to the viewer.

Since it's hard to extrat this data only looking at the bars, I've provided lines across the charts that compare the global average and the relative average of the data sets to each other as well as the individual cards.
